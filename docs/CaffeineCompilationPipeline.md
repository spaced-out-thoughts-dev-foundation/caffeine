# Caffeine Compilation Pipeline

1. [human in the loop] documentation step (writing specifications)
2. limited natural language definition interface
3. constraint structure processor
4. constraint executor
5. [human in the loop] ack'r
6. terraform plan & apply

Step 1 is, at this time, performed by a human. However, we believe it may, slowly, be aided by some sort of AI. Ultimately, we want a doubly ergonomic design:
* non-technical humans
* AI tooling (which largely thrives when things fit existing patterns and paradigms)

The goal here is to get to a state of dynamic, intent based, data backed, codified service expectations.
