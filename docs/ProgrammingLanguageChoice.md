# Programming Language Choice

A programming language is a tool to accomplish a job. We've chosen racket because we're working on a _programming language_ as an ergonomic, intuitive, unsurprising interface, and [language-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language-oriented_programming) seems like the best approach for the job. For backend bits, we're like to lean in to our Ruby expertise, however for the DSL and user interface bits, we're going to do our best to use
